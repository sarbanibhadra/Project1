https://finnhub.io - endpoint: quote (for realtime data)
https://polygon.io - endpoint: daily open/close (for historical data)



If we give up on historical stock data for any reason, alternative endpoints that are freebies from our two APIs are:

https://finnhub.io/docs/api/company-news "Company News" (although it's really just any old financial story that the company name appears in, between two chosen dates)

https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/get_v3_reference_tickers__ticker "Ticker Details V3" (which is just an overview of the company so stuff like number of employees, location of HQ, website etc)

A homemade Github project built with React gives an autocomplete field for stock symbols:
https://tickersearch.surge.sh/

This website has the professional version of the stock symbols autocomplete lookup in the navbar:

New York Stock Exchange website lists NASDAQ stocks as well https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/stock

A simpler stock list - catalogued by initial letter - of NASDAQ stocks where you can also pull data:
